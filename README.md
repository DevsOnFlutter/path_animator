## Getting started

Include plugin to your project

```yml
dependencies:
  path_animator: <latest version>
```

Run `pub get` and get packages.

### Build Animated Path

The `build` function creates animated path and returns it.

```dart
final animatedPath = PathAnimator.build(
    path: path,
    animationPercent: controller.value,
);
```

The returned animated path is then used to draw the path on the canvas.

```dart
canvas.drawPath(animatedPath, paint);
```

## Contributions

Contributions are welcomed!

**If you feel that a hook is missing, feel free to open a pull-request.**

For a custom-hook to be merged, you will need to do the following:

* Describe the use-case.

* Open an issue explaining why we need this hook, how to use it, ...
  This is important as a hook will not get merged if the hook doens't appeal to
  a large number of people.

* If your hook is rejected, don't worry! A rejection doesn't mean that it won't
  be merged later in the future if more people shows an interest in it.
  In the mean-time, feel free to publish your hook as a package on [https://pub.dev](https://pub.dev).

* A hook will not be merged unles fully tested, to avoid breaking it inadvertendly in the future.
